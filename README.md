# Clay-Oven-Construction
Clay Oven Construction Project
This repository contains all the relevant documents and materials for the Clay Oven Construction Project at WPI. Our project aimed to design and construct a functional clay oven for the WPI community, incorporating innovative design elements and efficient construction techniques.

**Project Overview**

The Clay Oven Construction Project was initiated to provide a unique and functional outdoor cooking space for the WPI community. The project involved extensive planning, site assessment, design innovation, and collaboration with various stakeholders including students, faculty, and technical experts.

**Key Elements of the Project:**

**Site Assessment:**
Conducted at Higgins Upper Lawn, chosen for its visibility and accessibility.

**Design Innovations:**
Included a multi-purpose pizza paddle and turkey scooper, and an internal thermal reflective layer to boost efficiency.

**Stakeholder Communication:**
Maintained regular communication with project managers, clients, sponsors, end users, technical SMEs, and construction workers.

**Procurement Planning:**
Identified and secured necessary materials including firebricks, clay, insulation material, metal door, and chimney from chosen suppliers.

**How to Use the Clay Oven**

The clay oven is designed for cooking a variety of foods, including pizzas and turkeys. Below are some general guidelines for using the clay oven:

**Preparation:**
Ensure the oven is clean and free from any debris. Preheat the oven by building a fire inside using suitable firewood.

**Cooking:**
Once the oven has reached the desired temperature, place the food inside using appropriate tools. For pizzas, use the multi-purpose pizza paddle; for turkeys, use the turkey scooper.

**Safety:**
Always use heat-resistant gloves and tools when handling food inside the oven. Ensure the oven is supervised while in use to prevent any accidents.
